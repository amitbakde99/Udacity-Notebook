## Final Assessment

[The information below is about the final assessment for Bertelsmann Scholars at the end of phase 1 of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree program. More information is available here: https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104]

Here is what you need to know about the Final Assessment:


The Final Assessment will be opened on Feb 20 at 00:00 am CET for all learners, and will close on Feb 21 at 11:59pm CET. There will be no other dates available to sit for the assessment.

The assessment is completely online.

Learners who complete the Challenge phase successfully will receive a link to take the assessment via email once the assessment is available on Feb 20 at 00:00 am CET.

The Final Assessment link expires at the exact time on the close date mentioned above. Therefore, we recommend eligible students to start their Final Assessment well in advance of the link expiration time as the assessment will terminate automatically by this time, and it will be closed, whether you were able to answer all the questions by then or not.

The Final Assessment can be attempted only once. So, please prepare well before the assessment.

The Final Assessment duration is 60 minutes from the moment you start the assessment. You’ll be able to see a countdown timer on the screen. Please note that you can’t pause the time, and once the timer reaches 0 seconds, the assessment will be automatically submitted whether you’re able to answer all the questions or not. So, make sure to start the assessment when you’re ready for that.

The assessment consists of 20 multiple choice questions (MCQs) about your track content.

This assessment tests your knowledge in the track you completed in the Challenge phase.

You cannot return to any previous question once you have answered or skipped it. So, make sure you take the time to thoughtfully answer each question.

Learners who get selected will be notified about their selection status for a Udacity Nanodegree Program Scholarship. This status update will be sent directly to participants via email on Mar 9, 2023. Please make sure to check your inbox (and Spam and Promotions folders) frequently during this period.

If you are selected for the Nanodegree Program Scholarship, you’ll have access to the Nanodegree and in turn start the program on March 16, 2023.
